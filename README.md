# Kagi-Nord-Theme

A theme for the Kagi search engine, based on the Nord Theme Pallette (https://www.nordtheme.com/)

# Current Issues

At the moment, there seem to be various issues regarding mobile support.
For example, there is a div in the search bar that has to have a background color or otherwise it's imcompletely filled. Except, on mobile it seems that this background color overfills it. No solution has been found as of now.

## How To Use

There are two methods for installation. You can either using the native[ Kagi custom CSS feature](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/custom-css.html#customizing-kagi-css) or use the [Stylus browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne).
